>>> DEMO FLOW 2: Ambiguous Query Understanding

User Query: 'How do I configure it for better performance?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: How do I configure Redis for better performance in my Python backend using FastAPI?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts', 'user_profile.prefs']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['What specific aspect of performance are you looking to improve?', 'Are you asking about Redis configuration or FastAPI configuration?', 'Do you have any specific performance metrics or goals in mind?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. User is looking into Redis for caching to speed up endpoints and prefers clean code architecture. The system must comply with GDPR and cannot use any cloud services, only on-prem.

User Query: 'Is it compliant with the regulations?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Is the system I am developing compliant with GDPR regulations?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['user_profile.constraints']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['Which specific regulations are you referring to?', 'Are you asking about GDPR compliance for your fintech application?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy. The system must comply with GDPR and cannot use any cloud services, only on-prem. User is also looking into Redis for caching to speed up endpoints.

User Query: 'Can we deploy this to AWS Lambda?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Can we deploy the Python backend for the fintech app, which is developed using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, to AWS Lambda?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['user_profile.constraints']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['Are you considering any specific limitations or constraints for the deployment?', 'Do you want to ensure compliance with GDPR while deploying to AWS Lambda?', 'Are you open to using cloud services for this deployment despite your current constraints?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. The system must comply with GDPR and cannot use any cloud services, only on-prem. User is also looking into Redis for caching to speed up endpoints.

User Query: 'What is the connection string format for the database?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI. The database being used is PostgreSQL, and the user needs to handle heavy transactions.

User Query: 'Why did we choose that over Django?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Why did we choose FastAPI over Django for developing the backend of the fintech application?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ["What specific aspects are you referring to when you mention 'that'?", 'Are you asking about the technical reasons for choosing FastAPI over Django?', 'Do you want to know about performance, scalability, or other factors?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI for its performance and async support, and is considering Redis for caching to speed up endpoints. The user is comparing FastAPI with Django.

User Query: 'Does it support async operations natively?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Does FastAPI support async operations natively?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['Are you asking about FastAPI or another technology?', 'Which specific technology are you referring to regarding async operations?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI, which is known for its performance and async support.

User Query: 'Are there any licensing costs for the tools we are using?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI for its performance and async support. The database being used is PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy is employed for ORM. User is also looking into Redis for caching to speed up endpoints. The user is interested in understanding if there are any licensing costs associated with these tools.

User Query: 'How do I handle the caching invalidation there?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: How do I handle caching invalidation when using Redis for caching in my Python backend for a fintech application?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts', 'user_profile.prefs']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['What specific scenarios are you considering for caching invalidation?', 'Are there particular data types or endpoints you are concerned about?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is developing a Python backend for a fintech app using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. User is looking into Redis for caching to speed up endpoints and is interested in handling caching invalidation.
