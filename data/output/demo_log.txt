>>> DEMO FLOW 2: Ambiguous Query Understanding

User Query: 'Why aren't we using GitHub Actions for this?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Why are we not using GitHub Actions for the CI/CD process in our project?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['user_profile.constraints']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['What specific concerns do you have about using GitHub Actions?', 'Are you looking for alternatives to GitHub Actions?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: The user is working on a fintech application backend using Python with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Redis, JWT, and 2FA for authentication. The deployment must be on-premise and fully GDPR compliant, with security as a top priority. The CI/CD process is set to use Jenkins because GitHub Actions is blocked in the internal network.

User Query: 'How should I implement the login flow?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts', 'user_profile.constraints']
 -> Final Augmented Context: The user is starting a new project, which is a backend for a fintech application using Python and FastAPI. They are implementing JWT for standard user authentication and enforcing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Admin accounts. Security is paramount, and the entire system must be fully GDPR compliant. The user cannot use AWS, Azure, or any public cloud, and the deployment must be on-premise.

User Query: 'Can we switch to SQS to reduce maintenance overhead?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts', 'user_profile.constraints']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is starting a new project, which is a backend for a fintech application using Python. The project is using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Redis for caching, and requires JWT for user authentication and 2FA for Admin accounts. The frontend team is building the dashboard using React, and the user requested a GraphQL API alongside REST endpoints. The user is planning to use Celery for background tasks with RabbitMQ as the message broker. For deployment, everything needs to be containerized with Docker, and for CI/CD, Jenkins is being used because GitHub Actions is blocked in the internal network. Security is paramount, and the entire system must be fully GDPR compliant, with a restriction against using AWS, Azure, or any public cloud, requiring on-premise deployment.

User Query: 'What are we using to serve the dashboard data?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Final Augmented Context: The user is starting a new project for a fintech application using Python with FastAPI as the backend framework. The frontend team is building the dashboard using React. The user has not specified the exact method or technology for serving the dashboard data, but they are implementing a GraphQL API alongside REST endpoints, which could be used to serve the dashboard data.

User Query: 'Is it compliant with the security rules?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: True
 -> Rewritten: Is the deployment strategy, which includes containerization with Docker and the use of Jenkins for CI/CD, compliant with the security rules outlined in the project?
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['user_profile.constraints']
 -> Clarifying Questions: ['What specific security rules are you referring to?', 'Are you asking about compliance with GDPR, or are there other security rules to consider?']
 -> Final Augmented Context: The user is starting a new project, which is a backend for a fintech application using Python. The project will be deployed on-premise, and security is paramount. The entire system must be fully GDPR compliant, and the user cannot use AWS, Azure, or any public cloud. The deployment strategy includes containerization with Docker and the use of Jenkins for CI/CD, as GitHub Actions is blocked in the internal network.

User Query: 'How do I configure the worker to consume messages?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Final Augmented Context: User is starting a new project, which is a backend for a fintech application using Python. The project will use FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Redis for caching, and implement JWT for user authentication and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Admin accounts. The frontend team is building the dashboard using React, and the user requested a GraphQL API alongside REST endpoints. The user plans to use Celery for background tasks due to heavy monthly report generation and will use RabbitMQ as the message broker for Celery. The user has also stated that everything needs to be containerized with Docker and that they are using Jenkins for CI/CD.

User Query: 'Does the database layer support the async requirements?'
 -> Is Ambiguous: False
 -> Memory Keys Needed: ['key_facts']
 -> Final Augmented Context: The user is starting a new project, which is a backend for a fintech application using Python. They have decided on FastAPI for the project and are using PostgreSQL for the database. The user is using SQLAlchemy 2.0 for the ORM and wants to keep the database layer abstracted. They also plan to use Redis for caching, implement JWT for authentication, enforce Two-Factor Authentication for Admin accounts, and use Celery for background tasks with RabbitMQ as the message broker.
